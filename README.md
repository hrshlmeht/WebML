TensorFlow.js Boilerplate
=================
This very simple skeleton simply loads in TensorFlow.js and prints out the version once loaded to the DOM.
From these humble beginnings you can do some really great things. 
Feel free to fork this and use it as a quick way to start coding with TensorFlow.js directly or following some other tutorial that needs TensorFlow.js to run.
